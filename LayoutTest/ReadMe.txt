Good example sizer controls taken from the site:

	https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.0/overview_sizer.html#overview_sizer_box

The screen has a text field section which will grow when the windows is resized, while there is button section at
the bottom of the screen who stay the same size, regardless of the windows being resized.

Also, a Hide button will demo how a sizer can be hidden, which can be handy in a GUI...
